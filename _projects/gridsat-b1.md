## Overview

GridSat-B1 is one of NOAA's first operational Climate Data Records (CDRs), providing a long-term, consistent record of global infrared brightness temperature observations from geostationary satellites. Developed to support critical climate monitoring and research applications, GridSat has established a reputation as a foundational dataset for understanding long-term climate trends and variability.

As a pioneering climate data record, GridSat merges observations from multiple geostationary satellites spanning several decades, creating a seamless, calibrated dataset that enables researchers and decision-makers to analyze climate patterns and changes over time. The product continues to evolve with modernization efforts to incorporate next-generation satellite capabilities while maintaining scientific continuity with the historical record.

## Data Description

GridSat-B1 integrates infrared brightness temperature observations from the global constellation of geostationary weather satellites, including:

- **GOES Series**: Multiple generations of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, including recent transitions to GOES-R series platforms (GOES-16 through GOES-19)
- **International Partners**: Data from EUMETSAT and other international geostationary satellite operators
- **Global Coverage**: Near-continuous observations from the full geostationary satellite constellation

The dataset employs sophisticated calibration methodologies to ensure consistency across different satellite platforms and generations:

- **Inter-satellite Calibration**: Advanced procedures using reference datasets including VIIRS Global Area Coverage (VGAC) data
- **Matchup Algorithms**: VGAC-ISCCP B1 techniques for next-generation calibration approaches
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive validation frameworks maintaining data integrity and climate record consistency
- **Long-term Continuity**: Careful assessment procedures to ensure seamless extension of the climate record across satellite transitions

## Applications

GridSat-B1 serves diverse scientific and operational applications:

- **Humanitarian Response**: Critical data source for USAID drought monitoring and early warning systems
- **Climate Research**: Foundational dataset for studying long-term climate trends, variability, and change
- **Weather Pattern Analysis**: Supporting research on tropical systems, convection, and large-scale atmospheric circulation
- **Historical Climate Studies**: Enabling analysis of multi-decadal climate patterns and trends
- **Operational Monitoring**: Providing consistent observations for ongoing climate assessment and reporting

The established quality and long temporal extent make GridSat particularly valuable for applications requiring reliable historical climate information.

## Technical Details

GridSat-B1 employs robust methodologies designed to meet NOAA Climate Data Record standards:

- **Processing Framework**: Operational algorithms following NOAA CDR Program requirements and documentation standards
- **Calibration Approach**: Evolving methodologies incorporating advanced reference datasets for improved accuracy
- **Validation Procedures**: Comprehensive comparison with historical records and reference datasets to ensure climate continuity
- **Quality Control**: Multi-level quality assurance procedures maintaining GridSat's established reputation
- **Modernization**: Ongoing upgrades to integrate next-generation satellite capabilities while preserving data record integrity
- **Automation**: Sustainable operational processing designed for long-term climate data stewardship

The technical implementation emphasizes maintaining scientific integrity while ensuring operational continuity, leveraging decades of experience in satellite climate data production to deliver a reliable, trusted climate data record.
