## Overview

The Visible-channel Global Albedo Climatology (VGAC) is a long-term dataset of calibrated visible-channel reflectances from the global geostationary satellite constellation.

## Data Description

VGAC provides intercalibrated visible channel data from multiple geostationary satellites including:

- GOES (East and West)
- Meteosat (0° and Indian Ocean)
- GMS/MTSAT/Himawari
- INSAT

## Applications

- Surface albedo monitoring
- Aerosol studies
- Cloud climatology
- Solar radiation estimation

## Technical Details

The dataset uses a standardized calibration approach to ensure consistency across different satellite platforms and generations.
