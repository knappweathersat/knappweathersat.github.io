## Professional Background

I have spent over 25 years in satellite climate science. I established this company to bring world-class atmospheric expertise directly to organizations tackling today's most challenging weather and climate problems.

## Core Operating Principles

My business operates according to four key values:

- **Scientific rigor meets operational practicality** - Delivering solutions that are both scientifically sound and practically implementable
- **Collaborative approach** - Building on existing expertise rather than replacing it
- **International perspective** - Bringing global best practices to local challenges
- **Rapid response capability** - Providing quick solutions without sacrificing quality

## Personal History

My passion for meteorology and computing began in childhood, including a 7th-grade science fair project focused on storms. I have maintained this interest throughout a 40-year career studying atmospheric phenomena.

## Current Focus

Rather than working within large institutional structures, I now provide rapid, focused solutions while maintaining the scientific rigor and quality standards expected from professional climate science.

## Location & Community

Based in Asheville, North Carolina, near major atmospheric research centers with convenient access to southeastern U.S. clients.

## Personal Interests

Outside of professional work, I volunteer with Scouting America and value how Scout principles translate to work and family life.
