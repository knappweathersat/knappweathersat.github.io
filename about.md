## Professional Background

I have spent over 25 years in satellite climate science. I established this company to bring world-class atmospheric expertise directly to organizations tackling today's most challenging weather and climate problems.

## Personal History

My passion for meteorology and computing began in childhood, including a 7th-grade science fair project focused on storms. I have maintained this interest throughout a 40-year career studying atmospheric phenomena.

## Location & Community

Based in Asheville, North Carolina, near major atmospheric research centers with convenient access to southeastern U.S. clients.

## Personal Interests

Outside of professional work, I volunteer with Scouting America and value how Scout principles (Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, ...) translate to work and family life.
