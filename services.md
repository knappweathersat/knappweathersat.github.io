## Service Philosophy
I believe complex atmospheric science should serve practical decision-making. My career has focused on converting advanced satellite research into practical data products for organizational use.

## Core Operating Principles
My business operates according to four key values:

- **Scientific rigor meets operational practicality** - Delivering solutions that are both scientifically sound and practically implementable
- **Collaborative approach** - Building on existing expertise rather than replacing it
- **International perspective** - Bringing global best practices to local challenges
- **Rapid response capability** - Providing quick solutions without sacrificing quality

## Service Offerings
I provide several specialized services:

- Expert consulting regarding geostationary satellite data (such as GOES systems)
- Development and validation of satellite-derived weather and climate datasets
- Advisory services addressing data continuity and sustainability planning
- Analysis and maintenance of tropical cyclone best track datasets
- Custom research projects and data interpretation
- Scientific reporting and publication support
